# HealthStat Analysis 
## Project Overview
- This project involves a comprehensive analysis of hospital discharge data from New York State over the course of one year. As part of an intermediate course on [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/case-study-analyzing-healthcare-data-in-power-bi), I was tasked on HealthStat, a fictional consulting firm, to identify insights related to hospital efficiency, specifically focusing on patients who underwent hip replacement surgery.
- The dataset consists of a single table with 30 columns, where each row corresponds to an individual inpatient stay, detailing the patient's journey from admission to discharge. Importantly, the health information contained within this dataset is anonymized and does not allow for individual identification.

**Check out my interactive Power BI dashboard [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOTRlODZjMzEtNjU2Ni00ODc0LWI3MGMtNDkwNmYyNjM2YjFlIiwidCI6ImJmZmI5NzQ4LTRhNTEtNDRjOC05MjBmLTkzOGFjNDc5NzFlNSJ9) to explore the insights in detail!**

## Key Features
1. **Data Loading:** I imported the data as a CSV file into Power BI, setting the stage for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning:** I cleaned the data by removing duplicates, fixing errors, and handling missing values to ensure accuracy.
3. **Data Transformation:** I transformed the data to make it more useful for analysis, which included reshaping and organizing it effectively.
4. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** I used DAX to create calculated columns and measures that provide deeper insights into the data.
5. **Visualization:** I created interactive visualizations to present the findings clearly and effectively.

## Highlights
- **LOS Comparison** - Summarize the patient discharges to gain insights into the patient profiles within the dataset. Additionally, explore how the average length of stay differs among various hospitals and how it correlates with the number of practicing surgeons.
- **Cost Comparison** - Identify hospitals that stand out in terms of performance and uncover the key factors that most significantly impact both the length of stay and the cost per patient discharge.
- **Hospital Profile** - This section provides a deep dive into the profile of each hospital, offering a comprehensive view of their performance metrics, and operational efficiencies.
