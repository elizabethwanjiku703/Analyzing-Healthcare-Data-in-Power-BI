# HealthStat Analysis 
## Project Overview
- This project involves a comprehensive analysis of hospital discharge data from New York State over the course of one year. As part of an intermediate course on [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/case-study-analyzing-healthcare-data-in-power-bi), I was tasked on HealthStat, a fictional consulting firm, to identify insights related to hospital efficiency, specifically focusing on patients who underwent hip replacement surgery.
- The dataset consists of a single table with 30 columns, where each row corresponds to an individual inpatient stay, detailing the patient's journey from admission to discharge. Importantly, the health information contained within this dataset is anonymized and does not allow for individual identification.
